          The poverty of the English language renders any description of Papa to be significantly inadequate. It is beyond the human tongue to be able to capture Papa's numerous qualities, but I can only tenaciously attempt to offer a glimpse of this incredible human being. Although these words are usually reserved for the divine, it is just as appropriate to define Papa as being omniscient and omnibenevolent. Those who have had the pleasure of ever engaging with my father, will attest to the fact that his wealth of knowledge coupled with his compassion is unparalleled in this universe. Love you Papa.</br> <p align="right">Vyas, 2018</p>
